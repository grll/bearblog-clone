* This project is an open-source clone of bearblog in python.
* Use uv as a depedency manager. Always add package with `uv add` or `uv add --dev` instead of modifying directly `pyproject.toml`.
* Add tests with pytest in the `tests` folder.
* ALWAYS favor minimalism and simplicity over complicated abstraction and extreme modularity.
